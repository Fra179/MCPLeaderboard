## > What is this leaderboard about?
This leaderboard tracks and displays the performance of students on the programming exercises offered in the course. It ranks users based on their runtimes. The better you parallelize and optimize your code, the higher you will rank.

## > How often is the leaderboard updated?
Updating the leaderboard everytime someone pushes a new solution would be too resource-intensive. Therefore, the leaderboard is updated automatically once every 24 hours. To be specific, every day at 23:00 UTC.

## > Why is my result not changing after I submit a new solution?
Since the leaderboard is updated only once every 24 hours, any new submissions will not be reflected immediately. Please wait until the next update cycle for your new results to appear on the leaderboard. If after the update your result is still not changing (check the hash of your commit), please make sure that you're pushing to the correct branch (usually `main` or `master`). If the problem persists, feel free to reach out.

## > Can I see more detailed informations about my run?
Yes, you can view more details (like stdout and stderr) by clicking on your username in the leaderboard. Use it to understand what's happening during the execution of your code.

## > What should I do if I still have problems?
If you still have a problem you can't solve, please write it either on the "Programmazione di sistemi embedded e multicore" telegram group (you can find the link [here](https://t.me/sapienzainformatica3)) or send an email to mcp [at] francescodb.it. The telegram group is usually the fastest way to get help.
